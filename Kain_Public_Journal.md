### Traveler's Blues - Session 4

Dinner with Capt. Rutger Smith, RNS Impossible. Many questions to ponder in a situation that doesn't make sense.

- Why would duchess commit to treason when she is the presumed successor to Aodan?
    - Is there influence by the Unseen Court (fey) on her actions?
    - Is she even in her right mind? Influence by spell or leverage?
- Who would benefit most from a new war?
    - Other than major industrialists, who are the other players?
- Why is Aodan presenting a new warship in peacetime when he is pursuing peace via marriage?
    - Is this a "shotgun" style wedding with the ship in place of a gun?
    - How would this marriage benefit Risur when Aodan is expected to step down in the near future?  
        Infiltration - First Steps
- All party members get Water Breathing spell cast on them (24-hr duration) (supplied scrolls intact)
- Party places sensitive items in water-tight bags prior to leaving ship
- Final explicit order from Capt. Smith: RHC officers (preferably sr. officials) will need to arrest Duchess, NOT the Navy
- Encountered Nicolas Dupiers in tunnel. Managed to subdue and convince him to assist in finding the best way out of the mines.
- Had 3 curious artifacts with him, one of which was apparently consumed by Arge's mechanical Raven. Upon eating the object, the Raven grew and converted to an Eagle.
- The other 2, in the shape of large golden medallions, Nicolas was successfully using to control elementals (1 earth and 1 shadow).
- Party was unable to convince Nicolas to part with the objects. He stated that they were found on the island and were kept at the fort. He admitted to stealing them when the island was overrun by Risuri forces. (The latter portion of his statement is suspect. Why would a simple miner have access to artifacts stored within a secure military facility?)
- Party has successfully exited the mines at the entrance C on the map and is stopping to take a quick rest.

## 500/Spr/75-76

### Exploration and Recruitment - Session 5

Team restarted work with a quick jaunt to the top of the hill, which overlooks the fort. Not much was discernable from this distance except general confirmation of location and large features.

Returning to the mine entrance the team encountered Dupiers friend, Pierre. He pointed out mass grave. Team convinced Dupiers and Pierre to introduce them to other refugees. While trekking across a stream, the landscape suddenly changed (blue sky, strange bog). Xugor had team stay still a few minutes to let the effect pass. Team met with locals at a "factory" type operation. Small handful of civilians and soldiers were present. Team convinced them to help find an engineer to infiltrate the fort and bolster forces. Team agreed to meet engineer on the road west of the fort.

While waiting for the engineer to arrive the team encountered a teifling who introduced herself as "Sprocket". She indicated that she was a mercenary (rat catcher) working for the duchess. She indicated that she had arrived with the duchess' forces via portal circle. Meeting ended without incident.

Dupiers and Engineer arrived. Team agreed to meet locals at fortress weak point (marked 3 on map) at 8PM. Team stopped for long rest (0700 to 1500).

### Fortress Infiltration - Session 6

Engineer pointed out a weak point in the wall where passwall (1hr. duration) would able to penetrate. RHC Team and a cadre of local residents entered the fortress after dark (8 - 9PM)

- Cadre of locals was tasked with raiding the jail (marked 5 on map)
- Team moved forward on main mission to open the sea gate.
    - Moving across fort we found that much of the Duchess' forces were drunk and not properly manning their posts.
    - Discussion with one soldier indicated a general depression about the affair.
    - Moving towards the lighthouse, the team disabled the portcullis control at the eastern gate from the harbor to the fortress town.

### Lighthouse and Sea Gate Control Room - Session 6

With a bit of bluffing the team was able to enter and take control of the facility. The team subdued those inside (sleep spell) and barricaded the doors. Sybilline launched the fleet signal flare as planned. Some scuffle ensued and the team repelled would-be attackers with appropriate counter-measures (caltrops, marbles, alchemist fire) and some light fighting. When attackers were informed that they were participating in a rebellion, many immediately ceased assault.

Upon arrival of the fleet, a wave high enough to crash over the fortress sea wall struck. I did not personally see the cause, but other team members reported that an amber colored, cylindrical object roughly half the size of the lighthouse struck the water outside the harbor. Stig and other team members went out to assist those washed into the harbor to minimize drownings. Stig, having consumed a water breathing potion, went out to investigate the amber colored object.

### Return to Fortress Town - Session 7

The team stood down (short rest) while military forces took control of the Fortress Town. Team opted to restart work with investigation at the jail site.

While making our way back into town a fire broke out on one of the assault ships. An elf was visible in silhouette and appeared responsible for the fire (later revealed as Asrabey Varal). Team went to the quay, provided assistance as needed, and inquired about attacker. Team moved to pursue attacker into town. Found several groups of soldiers who also encountered the attacker (and lost).

Descriptions from sailors and soldiers indicated that attacker 1) looked like famous fey warrior from 1st Yerasol War, 2) carried a flying shield and flaming sword, 3) appeared to be able to shrug of direct shots from firearms, and 4) was able to leap unnatural distances.

Private Observations (enciphered): Hsle lcp jzf wzzvtyr le, yzdj? (What are you looking at, nosy?)

- Burning handprints were observed on the ship, which could be indicative of Vekeshi magic.

Team found that prisoners had been freed as expected and that locals had mostly managed to stay out of the fight. Team briefly interviewed Hessar Marseine. The tower in the fort has apparently been primarily used as an astronomical observatory. Danoran archeologists have been performing excavations in a variety of places on the island. Of particular interest, an ancient temple was found in the southwestern portion of the island.

The attacker (Varal) appeared again and the team moved to pursue and observe. Varal used a magical object to alter reality in a sphere roughly 200 feet across. The effect was to make the inner keep wall disappear in the area for several minutes and allow passage. Team continued pursuit through the wall before reality returned to normal. Team encountered a fey druid (Ghillie Dhu) in the hedge maze and, when unable to negotiate passage, vanquished him.

### Central Tower - Session 7

Team arrived in the central tower to find that the Duchess' soldiers had been defeated. Proceeding to the upper-most floor, the team found Ambassador Varal and Duchess Ethelyn in a deadly confrontation. The team, surprisingly, was able to negotiate an end to the bloodshed. Key points overheard and discussed:

- Ambassador Asrabey Varal
    - Unseen Court upset about Duchess' attempt to overthrow the king and start a war. War with Danor or Civil war has zero benefit to the fey.
    - Stated that the fey see a marriage union of Danor and Risur as extremely bad news.
    - Varal stopped short of killing Luc Jierre when his wife's name was mentioned. Insisted that Luc accompany him back to Risur. (Risk unclear, but appeared to be more for questioning.)
- Luc Jierre
    - Present on Axis Island to use observatory. Stated that there are some relationships between magic in the world and planar motion (visible as stars to naked eye). Axis Island appears to suffer "fluctuations" due to the influence of more distant stars, particularly a blue star he had been observing.
    - Stated that he had seen Kasvarina, Varal's wife. She had apparently created the teleportation circle in the fort.
    - When presented with the option to be reunited with his cousin, Lya, he vehemently declined and indicated his willingness to leave with the Ambassador.
- Duchess Ethelyn Lesterman
    - Axis island was her target because Danor was building war machines here. She admitted to not having found any evidence of such activity. She then claimed that her "spy", Luc, had informed her of these activities. He informed her that she had grossly misinterpreted his words.
    - Stated that a skyseer from Shale had given her a "clear" prophecy which justified her actions.
    - Confessed to undermining the King and planning his untimely death.
    - Skyseer Prophecy: *A globe spins on its axis, and a steel ship sets off to war on a sail of shadows. The world passes into night, and blackness grips all of Risur as the stars fall from the sky. The king's eyes turn a soulless white, and he moves as a puppet, his strings pulled by a man who has already died a thousand times.*

### Amber Cylinder - Downtime

Stig stated that the object was absent from the impact site. Interviews with locals indicate that the intensity of "fluctuation" increases when 20 or more people are concentrated in an area. Iron is known to act as a stabilizer and minimize "fluctuation" activity. At this time it is reasonable to assume that the amber cylinder was, in fact, a fluctuation due to concentrated activity at the lighthouse.

## 500/Spr/78-90

### Return to Flint - Session 7

On arrival in Flint, team is met by Delft who gives them most recent newspaper. Among other things, it reports that Saxby took credit for Axis Island, though it's doubtful she left Flint. Several arsons and disappearances attributed to Gale. Team is ordered to restart Gale investigation immediately.

Written report provided to Delft along with items reported recovered.

### Downtime (11 days)

Like good government employees, team takes a week off.

## 500/Sum/1

### Death at the Consulate - Session 8 (23/10/12)

**NOTE:** Memory is a little hazy here due to hangover from Sower's Day celebration on the last day of Spring (player absent). Information is based on reports from Sybilline's tail.

Delft orders team to investigate dead body at the Danoran Consulate. Initial reports from local constabulary indicate that deceased had "flown" from a 4th floor window and been impaled on the fence. Delft hopes that the victim is Gale to get that case quickly closed.

Team arrives at scene to find that Lt. Alfred Bellastair (North Shore Div., FLC) is looking at the scene, but doing nothing to protect evidence from the crowd. Team took control of situation and had FLC lock down the scene.

**Facts**

- Nilasa Hume, victim
    - Injuries: 1) Injuries to the front of the body are consistent with jumping/flying/being thrown through a glass window. 2) Wounds to the scalp and face appear to be from animal claws. Someone attempted to hide this by healing after victim died. 3) Victim had been shot twice; leg and chest. Bullets had been removed before team arrived. Location unknown.
    - Search of the body found: 1) Bail certificate showing arrest and release dates. 2) Receipt for ~2500GP of items, initialed "DW". Note scribbled on back, "Silvo, Deorn Feldman, family wharf". 3) Empty potion vial. Investigation shows it to be Potion of Invisibility (highly illegal).
    - Detect magic showed that the body had multiple magical residues.
    - Victim had been working at the Consulate (job duties unknown).
- Crime Scene
    - Blood stain from a slashing attack found 20' from the window. This stain covered up by a carpet.
    - Blood stain from a gunshot found 10' from the window. Left in the open and obvious.
- General Observations
    - Consulate staff was cheery and upbeat when they should be frightened and/or disturbed. Drugging is suspected.

**Conversations**

- Braden Sarkin, Consulate Security
    - Witness and victim had been dating. Witness helped victim to get a job at Consulate.
    - Nilasa claimed to have been "almost" arrested by police, but had not returned to work for a week. He had not seen her in that time.
    - Knew that she was associating with criminals who had lately burgled the Consulate.
    - Nilasa had been looking for a large amount of money, but he had no idea what it would be used for.
- Julian LeBrix, Consulate Security Chief
    - Witness caught the victim stealing and tried to stop her from escaping.
    - Shot the victim in the leg, and when she flung herself out the window proceeded to shoot her in the back (fatal).
    - Odd inconsistencies in statements led RHC Constable Erebare to cast Zone of Truth, at which point witness shut down.

**Rumors**

- FLC Constable reported that an unidentified person was seen taking several things from the victim while she was still alive, impaled on the fence.

**Next Steps**

- Transport body to Local Constabulary office, nearby. Speak with Dead spell must occur within 3 miles of death site, making RHC HQ too far. Send runner to RHC HQ to get staff investigator who can cast spell.
- Request Nilasa's arrest record.
- Sybilline to investigate drugging of Consulate staff.

### Chasing Leads / Forgetting Ledes - Session 9 (23/10/19)

The team, excluding Sybilline, heads to FLC North Shore precinct office, where the body was transported. The following questions were prepared for the RHC investigator (Malise Rathmore, SME Dead People):

- What is your connection to Gale?
- What did you want to get from the Consulate?
- What happened in the last 5 minutes that you remember?
- Why did you want to contact Gale?
- Where can we find Nevard?

Sybilline arrives some minutes later, having consumed about a dozen of the presumed drugged brigadeiros which she was supposed to analyze (not personally taste test). I take the remaining pastries from her and can quickly tell by smell that they are laced with Fey Pepper, which I report to the team. Since she was apparently given free access to the consulate without escort, she procured several items which may lead the team in the right direction.

**Facts**

- Documents from consulate indicate Dr. Wolfgang von Recklinghausen is a potential witness to the murder.
    - Stated Residence is in North Shore
    - Character Reference 1: Dr. Barnaby Camp, North Shore
    - Character Reference 2: Prof. Lynn Kindleton, Bio Dept., Pardwright University
- Found Dr. R's apartment had been turned over
- Tracked down Prof. Kindleton in her classroom above a university adjacent butcher shop. Comments below.

**Conversations**

- Residence Landlord (bribed)
    - FLC constable who ID'd himself as Office Roger Porter had looked through the doctor's room and left before the RHC team got there.
    - Porter left a strange oily rag behind
    - Stated that doctor had been helpful, including doing some healing work (frowned on by Clergy).
- Dr. Barnaby Camp
    - Officer Porter had also visited him and asked questions. Described Porter as having a wound on his chest. He refused offered medical attention.
    - Witness was a friend of Dr. R and knew that he had been giving lectures at the university. Dr. R was a visiting lecturer, not a regular professor.
- Prof. Lynn Kindleton
    - Would not or could not reveal location of Dr. R.
    - Implications from conversation that witness and Dr. R were in a romantic relationship.

**Next Steps**

- Kain to follow up with FLC regarding Office Porter.
- Xugor and Arge to follow and keep tabs Prof. K.
- Track Dr. R in order to 1) get more details on Nilasa's death, 2) obtain items taken from her body.
- Look into Nilasa's activities and associates at Thinking Man's Tavern.
- Inform Heward Sechim of Nilasa's death and inquire about her activities.
- Try to find alchemist who sold Fey Pepper and Invisibility Potion to Nilasa.

### Downtime (about 18 hours)

- Met with former co-workers in FLC North Shore and nobody knows who Roger Porter might be. Inquiries with Parity Lake and Bosum Strand precincts get same story (good will shared with a few GP). It must be assumed that suspect is impersonating an officer.

**Arrest Report Key Points**

- Arrested in raid 500/Spr/85 (5 days ago) and released on bail, paid by Heward Sechim (adoptive father).
- Ford Sorghum and Travis Starter, known criminals, arrested at same time and remanded to Goodson's Estuarial Reformatory.

**Speak with Dead Report**

- What is your connection to Gale?
    - I got in contact with her through Nevard.
- What did you want to get from the Consulate?
    - The consul's office is closely guarded during the evening, so I wanted to sneak in during the day.
- What happened in the last 5 minutes that you remember?
    - I picked a lock on a drawer in the Consul's office. I grabbed a security packet that looked promising, and tried to flee. A *Risuri* man tried to get me to surrender, but when I bolted for the window a dark shadowy figure got in front of me and slashed me in the face. I think someone else shot me in the back. I jumped anyway, smashing through the window and invoked magic to fly, but it didn't carry me far enough. I must have died shortly after on the fence.
- Why did you want to contact Gale?
    - I was first drawn to her rebellious rhetoric last year. I was incensed at how many Flint factories mistreat their workers and thought it might be a chance to strike back at the owners.
- Where can we find Nevard?
    - He retired to a secluded henge in the Cloudwoods a few weeks ago to live out his dying days.

*Question:* Why was a random Risuri man in the Danoran Consulate and why did he try to stop Nilasa?

## 500/Sum/2

### The Thick Plottens - Session 10 (23/10/26)

**NOTE:** Memory is a little hazy here due to continuing repercussions from Sower's Day Party (player distracted by work). Notes augmented by Sybilline's tail.

*Newspaper 4 Today:* Reports of Nilasa's death. More Gale rumors indicating widespread fear of her. Bluster about Axis Island. Mafia turf war between Kell Guild and The Family.

Reports in hand, team moves forward tracking down the missing doctor. Delft lets team know that an RHC informant found "a copy of a deed of ownership for a canal barge, marked with the seal of the Danoran consulate" dropped in an alleyway nearby.

**Facts**

- Arge and Xugor met with landlord at Prof. Kindleton's apartment building. While negotiating for entry, team heard scream from the next door apartment (Prof. Xambria Meredith - Archeology). Team broke in to find a shadowy figure ransacking the place. Figure withdrew in surprise at the intrusion.
    - Figure was generally humanoid in shape, but strangely angular with featureless pitch black skin.
    - Gained access to Prof. Kindleton's apartment to "ensure assailant" didn't just move laterally. Arge and Xugor found some correspondence between Prof. K and Dr. R confirming suspected relationship.
- Met with Heward Sechim at his factory and informed him of Nilasa's death. Questioned him about her activities and threats to his business.
- Arge and Xugor followed Prof. K and grocery delivery boy, but lost boy when he entered the Nettles.

**Conversations**

- Butcher Shop Owner
    - Stated that Prof. K purchased several days of food instead of typical order (carcasses for dissection). Food was placed for pickup outside the shop.
- Prof. Lynn Kindleton
    - Thanked team for presence and protection. Stuck to claim that she didn't know Dr. R's location or how to contact him.
- Heward Sechim
    - Nevard Sechim (skyseer) is witness' uncle and said about a week ago, "An adopted daughter will blindly ride the wind to her demise."
    - Nilasa had been trying to get money from witness, but he had not supplied it.
    - Nilasa had been trying to befriend Gale and getting more involved with her organization. Witness believes that Gale is partly to blame for Nilasa's death. Asked team to intervene with Nevard and Gale to prevent these deaths.
    - Witness felt responsible for driving Nilasa toward extremist behavior; he had complained about how other factory owners mistreated their employees. Witness posited that threats agains his business may have also factored into her actions.
    - He stated that Risuri military had been pressuring him on costs and delivery timelines.
    - Also stated that a criminal organization representative had attempted to extort sale of the the entire business with threat of fire for failing to sell. Had one of his employees follow the suspect, but suspect escaped when entering the Nettles. Person has not returned lately.

**Next Steps**

- Head to Cloudwood to find Nevard Sechim

**Speculations**

- Roger Porter and shadowy figure are one and the same.
- Shadowy figure and Risuri man Nilasa saw before her death are the same.
- Shadowy figure may also be ragman considering animal style wounds to Nilasa.

### Run Rabbit Run - Session 11 (23/11/02)

**NOTE:** Kain sent to FLC precinct to book Kell Guild thugs into custody. Kain went to RHC HQ after to do paperwork (player absent). Additional notes provided by Sybilline.

Received the following message via courier:

> Greetings Kain, I am Lorcan Kell, I'd like you to meet me at a neutral location, one Lammers Theatre in Parity Lake. Please feel free to show up after 8pm tonight or tomorrow night. I know where the Doctor you're seeking is, let's discuss matters.

That afternoon...

**Facts**

- Team encounters and kills / arrests some Kell guild thugs. Thugs had kidnapped Morena. Thugs were also being chased by a group led by Renard Woodsman. (Morena is lover of the head of The Family? Cloudwood bandits = The Family?? Notes unclear.)
- Team meets with Nevard. He offers a *quid pro quo*: Introduce team to Gale in exchange for protection while he tries to get visions from top of Cauldron Hill.
- Team heads to The Nettles Mayor's Mansion, which is the only (legal) way up to Cauldron Hill. Team meets with Mayor Reed MacBannin and his butler Cillian Creed. (Encounter with "Doro"??)
- Mayor permits entry and sets the following caveats:
    - Everyone must pass through Mayor's manor on departure and return.
    - Everyone will be provided with an amulet to protect against possession by evil spirits.
    - Ascend and make camp before sunset. Encircle camp with provided goat's blood to distract spirits.
    - Stay out of sight and hide the light of your campfire.

**Conversations**

- Nevard Sechim
    - Believes that there is something in the Bleak Gate which is threatening Flint.
- Reed MacBannin
    - ?
- Cillian Creed
    - ?

**Next Steps**

- Meet with Lorcan Kell at 8:00PM
- Meet with Nevard Sechim following afternoon (Sum/3) to ascend Cauldron Hill

### Downtime (about 18 hours)

Before meeting party in the afternoon to ascend Cauldron Hill...

- Meet up with newspaper contact, Lorill Fletcher.
    - Share that RHC believes Ragman suspect was involved in murder of Nilasa Hume. Ragman is believed to be Risuri with a deep hatred of Danor. Hume entered the Consulate legitimately. RHC is following leads at this time.
    - Ask who is driving the news stories? Why so much hate towards Danor when country is on the verge of a long-term peace treaty?
- Meet with Calvin Van der Fell at Pardwright University.
    - Ask about Dr. R and those who might have attended his lectures
    - Follow up with attendees and ask about lectures
- Meet with Stover Delft
    - Provide a brief report on party's activities: Kell has requested interception of smuggled weapons. Suspicion of ragman involvement with murder, and team's ongoing follow-ups. Activities with Nevard Sechim in order to gain trust of Gale.

**Lorill's Comments**  
The King’s notion of a "long-term peace treaty" was just announced to the public a few weeks ago. Previously, the nation had been involved in an endless series of wars, and that good King Aodhan's hands weren't 'clean' when it comes to Danor. He led TWO separate strikes into the heart of the Danoran capital, first to seize the prototype of the current Coaltongue, and again a few years later torching a good quarter of their capital city. There were rumors that he even shelled orphanages in Cherage... He may want to retire with a clean conscious, but she doesn’t blame people for suspecting his motives. All that being said, she feels his peace efforts are genuine, and hopes he’s successful... but there are many older families that stand to increase their power from continued war. She refuses to say more, but you believe \[Insight roll of 15\] that she’s alluding to the nation’s nobility, who rarely dabble in the city of Flint.

Follow-up: Who owns the Tribune? Answer: Unknown, but edits are made to prevent offense to the rich.

**Dr. R Lecture and Background**  
You don’t have the time to track down many students, but you do get some details from Calvin and a few of the students that attended his lectures. The general consensus you gather is as follows: Dr. Wolfgang von Recklinghausen is a distinguished, intelligent, and poised gentleman in his late 30s. They note that he is an elegant speaker, albeit with a hint of menace from his sharply groomed goatee and a definite familiarity with the peculiar rapier he always wears. They feel he was likely born into wealth in his native Arrovia. While he refused to discuss many particulars of his past, he likely studied both medicine and magic. He did mention during his lectures that he had learned surgery in Danor and spellcraft in Risur. Everyone agrees the Doctor is a bit of a genius when it comes to surgery, and apparently has made some very long-term travel plans due to a rather messy divorce back home.

## 500/Sum/3

### Ghost Spotting - Session 12 (23/11/16)

**Facts**

- Nilasa's ghost appeared to everyone and announced that her killer was approaching.
- Team encounters shadowy figure who lobs light enchanted stones into camp and disturbs spirits. Fight ensues.
- Distinct odor noticed during encounter. Same odor as the oil stained rag found the previous day (witch oil).
- Team and Nevard leave hilltop between 3 & 4 AM and have a shared vision as they break camp:
    - The stars overhead seem to streak in lines as time stretches out, and then to the north, down by Parity Lake, a building catches fire with dreamlike swiftness. Suddenly, between two factories, watching two tongues of flame leap from one to the the next, like a pair of burning dragons. Screams erupt from the people trapped inside, the conflagration consumes the factories, and the charred buildings collapse to reveal tomorrow morning’s sunrise. A blackened sign sits in the ash, saying “Sechim’s Alkahest & Etchings.”

**Conversations**

- Sybilline
    - Rag found at Dr. R's apartment was coated in witch oil
- Lorcan Kell
    - States that he has Dr. R (unclear if just following or Dr is a hostage)
    - Requests team to "do their job" and stop a shipment of smuggled weapons. Offers *quid pro quo*: Destroy shipment or deliver it to him, and he will deliver Dr. R to RHC. Provides name of vessel: Li Grifoni Grinyande, Crisillyir.
- Nevard Sechim
    - States that he will make a major public announcement in a few days after he has had time to reflect on his visions.

**Next Steps**

- Investigate possible arson about to happen.

## 500/Sum/4

### Fire, Air, Water, and Oil? - Session 13 (23/11/30)

Team races down Cauldron Hill to try and intercept arsonists. After arresting Eberardo and Valando, team receives the following communique from Gale:

> Your character comes recommended by a dear friend of mine. At his suggestion, I would like to arrange a meeting so you and I may discuss a mutual enemy. Speak to the wind a time that is convenient for you, preferably within the next two days, and my canary will guide you when you are ready. The meeting will occur in my territory, because while I trust my dear friend, I confess I find him a poor judge of character. After all, he associates with me.

**Facts**

- Brief encounter with army brigade lead by Lt. Dale. Mayor MacBannin steps in a explains that he forgot to notify military of planned encampment.
- MacBannin performs cleansing rituals and recovers amulets.
- Team encounters arsonists at Heward Sechim's factory. Fight ensues.
    - Red Dragonborn brothers, Eberardo (fighter) and Valando (magic user), taken into custody.
    - Arge reports that they are known criminals from Ber.
- Team agrees to meet Gale at noon the following day (Sum/4).
- Team to reconvene at RHC HQ in the afternoon to give members opportunity to rest.

**Next Steps**

- Kain will use break to get interrogation information from arsonists and reach out to contacts in the city.

### Downtime (about 8 hours)

While other party members get *full rest*, Kain takes a *short rest*. Uses remainder of morning for the following:

- Work with RHC interrogators in interviews of Eberardo and Valando.
    - Try to ascertain which criminal group they are associated with and how they were paid.
    - Examine orders letters and try to determine if writing is recognized. Is there a signature or seal?

**Interrogation**  
Arge recognized Eberardo and Valando as rather infamous bandits from Ber. They refused to talk for a while, but did eventually break down and mention that a freelance carriage driver named Albert Eccleston delivered notes ordering their strikes, as well as handled payment once the jobs were complete. They leaned on Albert for details, and learned their orders were from the Kell Guild, but that payment was always issued by one guy, wearing various disguises... However they learned that individual always took various carriages back to Cauldron Hill.

### Running at Midnight - Session 14 (23/12/07)

Team hits the ground running in the afternoon. Tasks prior to disruption of smuggling operation: 1) Interview Heward Sechim about attempted arson, 2) Interview criminals associated with Nilasa: Travis Starter and Ford Sorghum, 3) Find apothecary with initials DW in Pine Island district.

**Facts**

- Team recovers large jug of witch oil (gallon or larger) from Heward. White spots observed in the oil.
    - *Between Scenes:* Between meeting with Heward Sechim and party's trip to Pine Island in the afternoon... Kain will turn in sample witch oil jar from Heward Sechim's factory. He will relate to Delft that other factories have also found them scattered about. Request that RHC and local constabulary find and collect other jars as evidence.
- *Between Scenes:* Team released Sorghum and Starter on condition that they become RHC informants. Provided them a meal and small amount of GP.
- Found suspect apothecary, operated by Dansica Waryeye.
- Bluffed entrance to vessel Silvo, captained by Deorn Feldman.
    - Accompanied smugglers to exchange with Crisillyiri ship. Name matched information from Lorcan Kell.
    - Dansica and Blander Waryeye provided "magical muscle" and Cpt. appeared to broker transaction.
    - Smugglers received wand cache as described by Sorghum and Starter.
    - Stig went back to RHC HQ to get backup and ensure that team was not ID'd as RHC.
- RHC backup arrives before dawn and takes everyone into custody. Team separated from other prisoners and quietly released.

**Conversations**

- Heward Sechim
    - Stated that three jugs of witch oil were found throughout factory, strategically placed.
    - Met with other factory owners and they also found similar jugs.
- Ford Sorghum & Travis Starter
    - Nilasa got money from Gale. Alleged that Gale had ties to merfolk who obtain money from sunken ships.
    - Believed that Nilasa had been working with The Family on behalf of Gale to smuggle in a cache of wands.
    - Nilasa was upset about treatment of workers
- Dansica Waryeye (second hand report from Sybilline)
    - Stated that receipt showed that purchaser received Fey Pepper and a potion of invisibility
    - When asked about potion, stated that Nilasa had provided a document authorizing the purchase
- Cpt. Deorn Feldman
    - Suggested that team meet with Morgan Cippiano at a coffee shop in the Stray River, corner of Yearling St. and Healers St.
    - Cache is to be delivered to Gale in the Cloudwood.

**Action Needed**

- RHC needs to recover all the witch oil (if possible).

**Next Steps**

- Use break to provide preliminary report to Delft on Nilasa death
- Meet with Gale
- Be present for prophecy announcement from Nevard Sechim

### Downtime (about 8 hours)

While other party members get *full rest*, Kain takes a *short rest*. Uses remainder of morning for the following:

- Meet with Stover Delft
    - Inform him that meeting with Gale has been arranged. Gale is withholding meeting location at this time.
    - Report that Nilasa's ghost appeared and it's identification of the killer, though the team couldn't capture and arrest them.
    - Ask about how sales of invisibility potions are handled. Notify him about probable illegal sale by Waryeye's in Pine Island. :: Delft - Activity is suspect and likely should be consequential.

## 500/Sum/5

### Flight and Fight - Session 15 (23/12/14)

Team rests and returns to RHC HQ at noon for appointment with Gale.

**Facts**

- Team meets with Gale as planned.
    - Receives ritual (spell), Detect Planar Energy, to help track down sources of Bleak Gate energy.
    - Receives a feather for a "Wind Orb" so that messages can be exchanged.
    - Kain provides "gift of goodwill".
- Team attended Nevard Sechim's ceremony in Dawn Square. Skeletons and Flayed Jaguars appear. Fight ensues.
    - Nevard arrived with "group of druids".
    - Second set of "Druids" arrive later found to be skeletons. They brought several rusted iron rings with them. Flayed jaguars appeared from the rings.
    - Small number of fatalities in crowd (2-5). Team protects Nevard and holds back jaguars until FLC reinforcements arrive in force.

**Conversations**

- Hana Soliogn, aka Gale
    - When confronted about arsons, stated that she did not commit or order them. She stated opposition to killing except in self-defense.
    - Admitted to encounter with Kane Westman (tax official, newspaper 3), which unfortunately got out of control.
    - Monologued at length. Verbatim statment below.

**Gale's Story**

> I have a contact, a courier to the Unseen Court, who lets me call him Ellik. He’s an eerie creature, dwells in shadows, but is loyal to the court and has a fondness for this nation which treated his people well for so many years. Just over a month ago, when the last new moon was aligned with the planet Nem, Ellik arranged for me to walk with him into the Bleak Gate. I will spare you the details of that journey’s emotional toll, but during the few hours that night when I could see into the dark side of the world, I discovered something.
> 
> There is activity in that mirror image of Flint. Not much. I never saw anyone other than my guide. Most of the buildings are hollow, like abandoned shells of dead sea creatures. But there are no echoes, and no wind blows, so you can hear footsteps from miles away. And in the distant gloom I saw torches and lanterns, lights that the denizens of that world would never need. Their path ran along the canal, to the still analogue of Parity Lake, and then up toward the Nettles. I did not have the time to get close, but I heard churning there, and saw smoke and steam drifting into the starless sky. They are working, assembling something, hidden right where we can’t see it, on the other side of our shadow.
> 
> My Nilasa found a clue. I sent her on a mission, and she found the truth, and they killed her for it. I am furious at her murderers, but Nevard has made me realize that this conflict is larger than my selfish desire for revenge. Unfortunately, I can’t return to the Bleak Gate, nor show you what I saw. The same alignment with Nem will not repeat for decades, and I have not yet found another way into that world. But I do have proof of my own.
> 
> This is a copy of a ritual that will detect various energies, though you have to have been exposed to what you’re seeking. Worthless to most people, but I have been to the Bleak Gate, and I believe that when you were with Nevard so did you, or at least you touched the veil. I’ve flown across this city, trying to find sources. In some place the stink of it bleeds through naturally, especially on Cauldron Hill, but I’ve followed trails. The night after Nilasa was murdered, I found a strong source at the consulate, and I tracked it across three districts before I lost it. And too often I’ve found it clinging to factories, or in the foyers of rich businessmen.
> 
> There is a conspiracy afoot. The Danorans are involved, industrialists in this city, and some third force in the Bleak Gate. They’ve already killed to protect their secrets. We need to find out what their goal is.

**Nevard's Vision**

> I saw a dark figure, standing atop Cauldron Hill, towering over our city. The sun set, and he cast a shadow across Parity Lake, stretching northwest, into the sea, beyond the horizon. He is born in our city, but his ultimate goal is elsewhere. And also things moved in his shadow—indeed, his shadow moved before he did, for while he was mighty, he was controlled by others.
> 
> I saw smoke hiding his face, for he was made mighty by industry. In my vision, a king chased him out to sea and defeated him by slicing him free from his shadow. But the cauldron had already shattered, and many thousands were drowned and devoured in its roil. I saw three birds alight on the peak, the first of black silk, the second of black steel, both weeping blood. But the third was made of stars, and it sang many songs.
> 
> I tell you this, Cauldron Hill is not safe. Twice will danger arise, and twice will we be deceived into thinking it is safe to return, but we must avoid the place and avoid being tricked.

**Next Steps**

- Investigate iron rings and source. Check fountain to see if one was already there.
- Talk to witnesses at Dawn Square
- Go with Nevard for final night of star gazing.

**Speculations**

- Jaguars from this attack are likely the missing cats mentioned in Flint Tribune (1).
    - Could account for ragman story, but need to find out who would be able to control them.

### Downtime (about 16 hours)

After attack in Dawn Square:

- Examine the bodies of the jaguars, then back-trace their steps (to the rings, which Kain did not see)
- Examine iron rings, get detect magic information from Stig or RHC members
    - Make inquiries about teleportation rings and how the ones at the scene could be used.
- Talk with witnesses in the square, see if anything unusual was noticed, maybe a "shadowy figure"
- Accompany Nevard Sechim (with crowd, presumably) to his henge for his final night alive.

**Jaguar Bodies**  
The body alterations (flaying and chestplate) appear to be "scientific" rather than arcane. Chestplates are attached with screws. Each has an intricately crafted collar. It appears that the blood has been replaced by witch oil. Additional necropsy work will require RHC specialists.

**Iron Rings**  
The Jaguars appeared from fountain and behind stage. Cleverly hinged iron rings were brought in by skeletons and placed behind stage. The bowl of the fountain is a rusted iron bowl. Shape and material are the only common factors. Stig casts, as a ritual, both Detect Magic and Detect Planar Energies. He does not detect any magic on either the fountain nor the rings, but does detect very strong and recent Bleak Gate energies on both.

## 500/Sum/6

### Religion and Medicine Don't Mix - Session 16 (23/12/21)

Team meets at RHC HQ in the morning. Xugor received a letter which he shares with the team. Arge gets a visitor at the office. Delft yells at team for not arresting Gale as ordered.

**Note to Xugor**

> You are a patriot. Already once you have defended the kingdom of Risur against enemies within its borders. Know that what you are about to reveal will damage our nation. I cannot tell you more, but if you can convince your companions to abandon this investigation, soon you will understand. I have taken no joy in conspiring to thwart you, so I give you this last chance to leave with your life. - CC

**Facts**

- Stig used the Detect Planar Energy ritual from Gale. Traced energies to a warehouse near Dawn Square. Appears that the jaguars were killed there and their blood replaced by witch oil. Appears that suspects abandoned the facility and tried to burn documents. One document provides ritual for the blood replacement and has a comment, "take the same precautions you would at the manor reservoir".
- Dr. Recklinghausen found in Nettles Church being guarded by Kell Guild thugs.
    - Arge's contact provides a location to find Dr. R and how to safely approach him.
    - Arge provides rouse to clear local vagrants from Nettles Church
    - Team in progress with extraction when Cillian Creed shows up and attacks.
    - Creed's appearance and attacks match "Shadowy Figure" (and Nilasa's healed wound). Connection confirmed.
    - Team successfully defends and Cillian withdraws when Leone Quital shows up.
    - Quital gives team 1 hour to release Dr. R and documents or he claimed he would kill Prof. Kindleton.
- Team manages to escape through a chimney with Dr. R and Nilisa's items, avoiding another confrontation.
- Team's quick review of documents indicates that stolen items appear to be showing up in another project, potentially a warship.

**Conversations**

- Dr. Wolfgang von Recklinghausen
    - His review of file indicates it had been compiled by Julian LeBrix. It lists financial irregularities in Danoran business and thefts against same.
    - LeBrix had reported discovery of "strange black oil with floating motes of white light". Witness states this description matches witch oil.
    - Witch oil is produced when Bleak Gate energy bleeds into the regular world. It can be "empowered" by collecting souls awaiting their final rest. This empowered oil can be used as a substitute for spell components.
    - It is extremely rare to obtain more than a few ounces.

**Next Steps**

- Save Prof. Kindleton
- Get arrest warrants for Cillian Creed and Leone Quital
- Interview and potentially arrest Mayor MacBannin

**Speculation**

- Is warship actually an underwater vessel? Is it being built in the subway tunnels that recently flooded?
- Creed is operating out of Cauldron Hill, but who is pulling his strings? MacBannin? Someone else? Does Kell Guild make sense here?

### Downtime (about 16 hours)

- Inquire in RHC and Pardwright university about teleportation and rusted iron rings, including possibility of ring acting as a doorway to the Bleak Gate.

## 500/Sum/7

### The Cauldron Cracks - Session 17

Team met first thing in the morning and discussed events of the last several days. Determined that Julian LeBrix needs to be interviewed immediately. Prof. Kindleton expected to be in the company of Cillian Creed. Creed is prioritized as first arrest of the day. Delft tells team to avoid arresting MacBannin.

**Facts**

- Sybilline produced evidence that Kell Guild has been buying up factories. They also own the barge for which the RHC found the deed in an alley.
- Team encountered Morgan Cippiano in the taxi and has a brief conversation.
- On arrival at Nettles Mayor's Mansion, party is met by MacBannin and staff, fight ensues.
    - MacBannin greets party with strange statements which sound like he took a class in sarcasm and failed. Team is suitably stunned as they expected to tell him that they were arresting the butler.
    - When asked about the "reservoir", MacBannin makes statements about peon status of team and that king is in the loop.
- Earthquake occurs and sinkholes filled with witch oil start appearing around the grounds. Manor House is split in half by earthquake, then further destroyed by sinkholes. Vapor from burning witch oil comes up from the ground and starts killing the plants.
    - He orders his household staff to kill the RHC team (most in full uniform). Kain announces that he is under arrest for making that order.
    - MacBannin drinks potion made from the "Bond of Forced Faith" ritual. Several of his staff are killed as the party attempts to subdue the Mayor.
    - Team manages to subdue MacBannin and effect the arrest. Gardener gives up when his imminent death is apparent.
- Cillian Creed is still loose.
- Sent message ahead to Delft to expect arrival of arrested mayor.

**Conversations**

- Morgan Cippiano
    - Tells team that they got his attention by disrupting the (wand) shipment.
    - Requested that team "overlook some indiscretions" by the Waryeyes and several others. Team informs him that the Waryeyes are now known to the RHC as a whole. The team agrees not take action against them at this time, but that there is a cost (information) that will be expected in kind.
- Mayor Reed MacBannin
    - "Ooh! You found me! Do you want a tour of the dungeon in the basement?" and other such odd statements.
    - Statement to the effect that everything going on here is known and condoned by the King
    - Instructed Creed to check on the (something something) after the earthquake. (Creed ran off.)
    - Quote: "I believe the earthquake has damaged something in the workshop under the garden shed. We may be minutes away from seeing the worst industrial disaster Flint has seen in decades."

**Next Steps**

- Before day is over...
    - Meet Julian LeBrix (away from Consulate, maybe Thinking Man's Tavern) and get information about stolen documents. (Arge/Xugor)
    - Investigate what's left of Mayor's Mansion and look for evidence of Prof K. (Erebare with Dr. R)
    - Investigate "garden shed", "workshop", and "reservoir". (Kain/Sybilline/Stig)
- Next several days
    - Track planar energy around city. Kain suggests looking in and around subway being built.
    - Track locations and movement of witch oil.
    - Find and arrest Cillian Creed.
    - Get RHC to announce that Gale has been cleared of the arson accusations.
    - (other suggested items)

**Thoughts / Speculation**

- Based on events of the morning, Creed is definitely working for MacBannin.
    - Suggests that arsonists were working under MacBannin's orders.
    - Implies that MacBannin was looking to harvest souls from factory fires to "empower" the witch oil.
    - Handwriting comparison recommended to confirm.
    - How is Kell Guild tied to this? Just transport of witch oil via barge? Assistance in arsons?
- How are these connected to military operations?

## 500/Sum/7-8

### Tying Off Threads (Inter-Session)

- Julian LeBrix / Security Packet
    - RHC review of security packet indicates that factory hostile takeovers all tie back to MacBannin. Purchases had been made through shell companies with the assistance of Kell Guild members.
    - LeBrix stated that his investigation was impeded by the Danoran consul. He provided Erebare a method to create Vendetta Bullets.
- Prof. Kindleton / Dr. Recklinghausen
    - Prof. K was found by rescue workers during search of the Nettles after the massive witch oil spill. Due to the incident, Dr. R. altered his travel plans and intendes to leave for Ber instead of Danor.
- Cillian Creed / Leone Quital / Remains of Mayor's Mansion
    - The mansion is entirely destroyed by sink holes by the time the team returns to the scene. Search of the "Garden Shed" reveals only another rusted iron ring. Team needs to find out how these operate.
    - Quital is a total unknown. Creed appears to have vanished.
- Search for Planar Energies
    - Many traces found, particularly along Stanfield Canal and around base of Cauldron Hill. Witch oil spill is generating huge amount energy, potentially blotting out individual locations.
- Reports Filed
    - [Death at Danoran Consulate (Case Closure)](joplin://a04f459f402f4b9b8b88277fc5c1f649#death-at-danoran-consulate-case-closure-500sum1-7)
    - [Smuggling](joplin://a04f459f402f4b9b8b88277fc5c1f649#smuggling-500sum4-5)
    - [Attempted Arsons](joplin://a04f459f402f4b9b8b88277fc5c1f649#attempted-arson-500sum4)
    - [Dawn Square Incident](joplin://a04f459f402f4b9b8b88277fc5c1f649#dawn-square-incident-500sum5)
    - [Mayor MacBannin Arrest](joplin://a04f459f402f4b9b8b88277fc5c1f649#mayor-macbannin-arrest-500sum7)

### Actions Based on Official Reports

- Death at the Consulate (Nilasa Hume)
    - Canary in a Coal Mine (Recovered Magic Item): Item procured from evidence by Cst. Tresseur.
    - Security Packet (Recovered Item): Copies of key documents procured by team. Original packet returned to LeBrix on orders of RHC.
- Arsons
    - Appears that attacks were meant to intimidate owners into selling. Again, evidence points back to MacBannin and Kell Guild.
    - RHC recovers ~100 gallons of witch oil from various factory locations.
- Dawn Square Incident
    - Military confirmed dead jaguars are the ones missing from the academy grounds. Jaguars were controlled by collars they were wearing.
    - MacBannin has been known to dabble in dark arts, but is not a known necromancer. He likely has insight into how to control undead.

## 500/Sum/8-90

### Suicide by Death

Mayor Macbannin, in front of witnesses, cracked his own egg and died from the injury. Immediately prior he talked to himself, then smoked a cigarette. Case was handed to another RHC team.

Having apparently annoyed our boss's boss, the team has been assigned desk duties. Idle chit-chat at the local public house after work indicates that Saxby thinks our team is getting more popular than her.

RHC investigations into MacBannin yielded some interesting items. He believed that he was tasked with creating weapons that could counter Fey Titans. Fears are arising that peace with Danor could leave Risur weak if the Titans awaken. Kaja Stewart, lead witch oil research technician, has been announced internally as a person of interest.

### Wrinkle Time (81 days of downtime)

Being a fairly motivated group, the team doesn't let the paperwork get them down. Requisitions are put into the quartermaster for items expected to be of use (+1 weapons for Csts. Kain and Tresseur, healing potions, and other necessaries). Each spends free time working on better ways to kick cloaca (leveling).

## 500/Aut/1

### Public Expositionism - Session 18 (24/01/18)

The team gathers for morning briefing and is told that they get their first field work for a while... as convention security. -\_- The Kaybeau Arms and Technology Exposition (KATE) is the actual event name. They are to report to FLC Sgt. Sara Lockheart, then keep an eye on things. Delft recommends staying out of the spotlight (newspaper). Team to keep lookout for Kaja Stewart, who has been fencing arcane items stolen from the Nettles Mayor's mansion.

KATE offers three main venues: Military, Rail, and Industry. It is being held in Flint's largest public park. Team checks in as ordered, then wanders the event. Lockheart indicates that FLC will handle common crimes (pickpockets, drunks, etc.). Team meets with Benedict Pemberton who shows off remote controlled armor and BEAR. Team meets with Heward Sechim and taste tests the "acid" (actually strong alcohol distillate).

### KATE Terror - Session 19 (24/01/25)

**Facts**

- While passing near the Gun Alley several strange creatures appear. The largest appeared to be the disembodied maw of a giant worm surrounded by tentacles. The smaller creatures looked like flying moth-eared elephant heads. All of the creatures appeared to be phasing between corporeal and incorporeal.
- The team noticed a high correspondence between magic item use and appearance of the smaller creatures. Simon Langfield identified as the owner / wielder of the staff and ordered to stop using it by RHC.
- Simon Langfield, Rock Rackus, Kvarti Gorbatiy tried to assist RHC team in putting down the creatures.
    - Kvarti and Rock both used firearms during the fight
- Team arrested Rock for the death of attendee. Kvarti and Lanfield detained for questioning. (see below)

**Conversations**

- Simon Langfield (Exhibition attendee)
    - Stated that he had purchased a "wooden" staff from a woman fitting the description of Kaja Stewart. How the staff converted to the current gold state is unknown.
- Alfonse Irongut (Owner, Al's Ammo, Exhibitor)
    - Simon was attempting magic missiles to get discount when the creatures started appearing.
    - Son, Alforb was swallowed by the Worm Maw and died.
- (Crowd)
    - Cries that person had been shot. Some mob mentality against Rock Rackus after statement by Kvarti.
- Kvarti Gorbatiy
    - Stated he saw shot from Rackus hit (and kill) an exhibition attendee.
- Rock Rackus
    - No statement at this time.

**Next Steps**

- Check area for Bleak Gate energy and iron rings.
- Search area for Kaja Stewart or witnesses to her presence.
- Recommend charges for both Kvarti and Rackus who used firearms in a public crowd.

### Inter-session

- RHC (not player's characters), under orders of the King, confiscates all magical and military items found in the area around the incident.
- No Bleak Gate energy or iron ring found. Though creatures appeared on use of the staff, they did not disappear like summoned creatures when killed.
- Inquiries into what the creatures are yields no information. Nobody has seen them before.
    - RHC receives request from Col. Harlock, Pine Island Battalion Academy, for the corpses of the creatures.

### The Interlopers - Session 20 (24/02/15)

**NOTE:** Kain on scheduled day off for Stray River community event he was running (player absent). Notes here summarized from comments by Sybilline.

**Facts**

- Lord Viscount Insp. Nigel Price-Hill (RHC National Director) is in Flint for an audit. It is recommended that team avoid the office.
- Team worked to track down Kaja Stewart.
    - Sybilline received a tip through a business front of The Family. One Dozy Miccini, a cobbler (and fence).
- Encountered Stewart at the Lanternwood subrail station (under construction) and conversed.
    - Erebare purchased gun shield from Stewart.
- Team encountered new RHC team lead by Sprocket (!!!) outside the subrail station.
- Sprocket Case Assist
    - Human body and mangled golem were found in a factory that collapsed during the earthquake.
    - Evidence of broken necklaces on both (attached items missing).
    - Rusted iron ring found nearby.
    - Human was bound by steel bars. Injury to head indicates fatal blow from golem. Appears to have been forced to swallow witch oil, but it seems soul was not captured.
    - Golem was ripped to pieces. Exquisite quality. May have been intelligent.
    - Human's socks were monogrammed, "AG".
    - Small piece of torn fabric from a magical garment found near the iron ring.

**Conversations**

- Kaja Stewart
    - Unwilling to discuss witchoil research.
    - Had put in some work to study sword, staff, and amulet. Side effects mentioned but not detailed. All were attuned to combat fey and outsiders (planar creatures).
    - Admitted to having taken staff, sword, and amulet from MacBannin's mansion.
    - Admitted to selling staff Langfield.
    - Offers amulet and sword for sale (28,000 and 32,000gp respectively)
    - Agrees to meet again at same location.
- Sprocket
    - They were brought onboard after *recommendation by Gov. Stanfield to Saxby*.
    - Her team has the remains of the MacBannin case and wants opinion on body and golem.

**Next Steps**

- Team wants Kain to see if GP can be obtained by Gale. (Unlikely in available time.)
- \[Sybilline / Kain\]
    - Go to university and follow up on sword, staff, and amulet, specifically creators, myths, etc...
    - Look for same information about iron rings and bleak gate
    - Pull in RHC office staff to look for stolen item reports
    - Determine location of staff (sold to Langfield)

**Inter-session**

- Hans Weber, Prof. of Antiquities and curator of the Natural History Museum (human from Drakr)
    - Preparing for Exhibition of items recovered by Dr. Xambria Meridith from a ziggurat in the High Bayou near Bole.
    - Dr. Meridith's sponsor, Caius Bergeron owns the items.
    - Presents document claiming that the sponsor has willed the items to the university on his death.

## 500/Aut/3

### Grand Theft Artifact - Session 21 (24/02/22)

**Facts**

- Having found an owner claiming the items, team gets an arrest warrant for Kaja Stewart.
- Meets with Kaja Stewart, requests items to be returned to rightful owner.
- On refusal, combat starts. Combat ends with Stewart's capture and arrest.

**Conversations**

**Next Steps**

- Get answers from Stewart

**Inter-session** Stewart Q&A (Sybilline's grooming and coffee preference questions edited out.)

- Does she know anything about the iron rings?
    - > The iron rings are half of a process allowing easy access to the Bleak Gate. Using the rings for travel also requires the traveler to wear a magical amulet. The how and whys of the rings predates her time with Macbannin, but the research involved is very stable. That research allowed her to leapfrog her own studies by decades once she got involved. As a theoretical planar physicist, she has been researching ways to take advantage of the veil between the Bleak Gate and the real world.
        
- Spill the beans on WitchOil and what she knows.
    - > It is a type of planarite, similar to fire gems. Much like fire gems, by using a fusil the energy contained in a fire gem can be harnessed to perform a task – IE; firing a bullet from a fire gem fusil.
        
- What is the control mechanism for her walking turrets?
    - > Once activated via a mental command, they attack anyone other than her that enters their range.
        
- How do they differentiate friend/foe if autonomous?
    - > They’re rather stupid and will attack anyone other than herself in their range.
        
- How was she sharing injuries with her automaton/iron golem?
    - > She created a warding bond that links the two of them.
        
- What was her interaction with Caius?
    - > None. She was present when the tiefling first showed up at the Mansion, although she didn’t learn his name until much later. She recalled Reed saying something about it ‘compromising protocol’ and being very angry about the meet-up.
        
- Did Caius give her the artifacts? (Or who specifically - if she said, "Three tieflings or even (a) tiefling" I want a description. (then run this past Xambira to see if that is one of the assigned "helpers".)
    - > He left a trio of ‘concerning’ items from an archaeological site with a neutral third party (a Flint bank) for Reed to research, she didn’t have a chance to examine them for danger prior to recovering them, but she did after his death.
        
- When was the last time she saw Caius?
    - > Just that one time, a few weeks before his death.
        
- Did Caius have any dealings with Mayor MacBannin? If yes, go into details
    - > She’s only aware of that single meeting. She’s fairly certain he wanted them to research the strange side effects the items have when used, as Reed was famous throughout Risur as an expert on dark arts and curses.
        

## 500/Aut/4-6

### The High Bayou Ltd. - Session 22 (24/02/29)

**Facts**

- Team meets with Dr. Meridith for a strange interview. Seems out of it and has a hard time remembering.
- Team decides direct investigation of the dig site is needed.
- Delft agrees that team should stay out of the path of the audit.
- Train trip to Bole, then horse / foot trip to Agate (nearest town to dig site)
- Agate residents confirm Xambria's story. They also note that another party came through a couple of weeks ago and returned with a 6' circular object wrapped in cloth.
- Team rents skiffs and purchases "offal offering" for local fey to prevent unneeded disruption to travel.
- Bodies of the dig team is found. Cause of death is not apparent, but all have strange lumps or buboes. Death seems fairly sudden.
    - Their gear has been searched, no useful items left. Journals have been tossed in the bayou and destroyed.
- Initial exploration of ziggurat shows that elemental puzzles abound (ooc think end of Fifth Element)
- Map room found indicating location of another zigurrat north and east of current location (identified as in Ber or waters just north of it).

**Conversations**

- Dr. Xambria Meridith
    - States that she left the dig site for several days to get supplies. When she came back everyone was dead.
    - Ziggurat was full of traps and diggers took a lot of time to bypass them.

**Next Steps**

### Pyramid Night - Session 23 (24/03/14)

**NOTE:** Kain rolled a 1 on perception and was told to stand in the corner (player absent). Notes from conversations with group.

**Facts**

- Team worked their way further into ziggurat, solving puzzles along the way.
- On completion of the rainbow bridge, they receive a vision (noted below). All characters learn language of the Ancients.
- The team, taking a queue from Kain about perception, steps squarely on the last trap before getting to the seal. The trap causes the ziggurat to flood and raises all dead creatures in a mile radius.
- After escaping the ziggurate, the team is accosted by the Fey Titan, The Voice of Rot.
    - All spellcasters in party now have access to Detect Planar Energy

**Conversations**

- The Voice of Rot
    - > My slumber is disturbed. You, agents of King Kelland, shall redress this offense. Most that fled your mortal trap were mute beasts. One had reason. It can be judged. Follow the scent of its homeland’s blood. Find it. Cut its flesh, then do as you please. Kill it, and it will rot. Send it home, and it will despair. Either, and I shall be appeased.
        

**NOTE:** King Kelland has been dead for 17 centuries.

**Next Steps**

- Track down creature that escaped and placate the Fey Titan!!
- Track down stolen seal.

**Vision**

> A vision that seemed to originate from ancient times. You see the three mummified guardians of the ziggurat, back when they were alive. The three orcs, dressed in primitive hides and armed with their iconic relics – staff, sword, and amulet – stand in a bare cave surrounded by semi-translucent creatures. They form a blockade in front of a golden plate set in the wall, and the monsters hesitate to attack.
> 
> The sword wielder barks something in his Ancient language, although you're able to understand their words. "War beasts of Gidim! Toteth’s seal failed."  
> "A trick," growls the amulet-wearer. "They’re from Gidim, but I smell the dust of Apet on them."  
> "Sniff them later," says the sword wielder. "Think at them so I can cut them."  
> The staff wielder closes his eyes as if in meditation. One of the monsters nearest the sword-wielder turns solid, and the warrior hews it in two with his obsidian-edged great sword.

### The Great Chase - Session 24 (24/03/28)

**Facts**

- Tracks escaped creature (radiating Apet energy) brings team back to Bole. Energies show that creature is heading for Flint.
- Enquiries about adventuring party that stole the seal show they headed to Flint also.
- Message exchanges with Delft indicate Bergeron has been found and is dead. Investigation starts on arrival in Flint.
- Body found in a locked room. Money and paper were ignored. Victim had brain removed through roof of mouth.
- Dr. Meridith was last in contact with victim 24-48 hours ago, around time of death.
- Witnesses at hotel heard Meridith and Bergeron arguing about a map in the dining room.
- Apet energy found throughout area. It appears creature passed through the walls of the building.
- Tip received stating that Meridith left aboard a steam vessel, "The Dagger", heading to Ber ziggurat.
- Word from RHC about strange happenings
    - People along Stanfield Canal are being driven insane by an unknown cause. Victims are being taken to floating prison in Flint Harbor.
    - 2 other people had their brains removed in same way. RHC didn't notice until higher profile victim was ID'd.

**Conversations**

**Next Steps**

- Continue chase. Work with RHC to get a vessel lined up for following morning. Perhaps Impossible, if the vessel is available.

**Inter-session**
- Engage city contacts (Ford Sorghum and Travis Starter) to look for additional victims and location of stolen seal.

## 500/Aut/17

### By Land or Sea - Session 25 (24/04/04)

**Facts**

- Arrived at ziggurat location about 1.5 miles off the coast of Ber (nearest world map location is Pezarillo).
- 3 vessels at anchor at the site. The Dagger, chartered by Xambria, "La Inspiración", a Beran research vessel, and "Il Draçon de Mer", a Crisillyiri mercenary clipper.
- Of interest on the Beran vessal is Paco De Los Loros, a goblin archeologist.
- Team finds that Xambria has a medalion similar to the ones found on Axis Island. It radiates Apet energy.
- Paco has found another medalion at the site, presumably eminating Mavisha energy.
- While team suspects Apet creature is inside Xambria, we are unable to coerce it with Thoughtform Attack.
- Snooping around Crisillyiri vessel by Arge's imp reveals nothing interesting.

**Conversations**

- Dr. Xambria Meredith? (Team suspects possession.)
	- Confirmed argument with Bergeron regarding journal.
	- Stated that she wanted to stop the opening of another seal.
- Paco De Los Loros
	- Hired and supplied by Bergeron to dig at site.
	- Told to stand down when the seal was excavated.
	- Kicked off site by Finona and her team (Druid(s), Fighters, Spell casters).

**Next Steps**

## 500/Aut/17-18

### Dragonborn in Speedos - Session 26 (24/04/11)

**Facts**
- Team meets with Finona, the teifling heading the group that's been removing planar seals.
- She agrees to allow team to observe removal of seal if they don't interfere.
- Team takes a swim down to the ruins of the ziggurat, roughly 100' below the water surface.
- When seal is opened, creatures try to break through immediately. Finona's team decides to backs out of the process and reset the seal.
- On return to the surface, team finds that the Dagger and Beran vessels have been set on fire.
	- Crew members and Paco have been slain. Their brains removed just like Bergeron.
	- Dr. Meridith is absent.

**Conversations**

- Finona (not Fiona ➡️ 😺)
	- Not really forthcoming about her activities prior to seal removal. Just states they have a "procedure", but won't elaborate.
	- She and her team have removed 3 other seals. Specifies the location of the seal in Flint and where they plan to take the local one after it is removed.
	- After failed seal removal, states that she's getting out of this particular work. She's directing mercenaries to head to Crisillyir as planned.
	- Admits to having Dr. Meridith's journal and gives it to team on return to the surface.

**Next Steps**
- Figure out where Dr. Meridith went.

### Honor Impugned - Session 27 (24/04/18)

**Facts**
- Search for Dr. Meredith is unfruitful. Eventually detect magic cast and signs of teleport are found.
- RNS Impossible arrives (with Rock Rackus aboard).
- Rackus offers team teleport travel back to Flint.
- Team discovers that Dr. Meridith arrived by teleport. Confirmed by Risur military.
- On arrival in Flint, Delft calls team to Pardwright University to meet with Hans Weber.
	- Weber produces note from Dr. Meridith indicating an attack on the Gala Exhibition.
	- > Hans - Help me. It followed me from the dig. It has me. I only have a moment. It wants the three relics. Warn the constables. It talks in my mind. I know things I couldn't. Its name is Sijhen. I hear the word gidim. Gidim. Gidim? Gidim. A people? A world? Another name, a name it's curious about. Obscurati. Obscurati? OBSCURATI.
- After the university, Delft directs the team to meet with Saxby and Price-Hill.

**Conversations**

- Rock Rackus
    - Bluster and hot air. Nothing interesting except offer of teleportation back to Flint.
- Inspectress Margaret Saxby
	- Lambasts team for misuse of RHC resources, theft of property, association with criminal elements in the city, and outright murder.
	- (Kain is stunned by all of these things. Property items were logged into evidence per policy. Criminal contacts should be expected since we have informants. Murder is just ridiculous.)
	- Stig politely takes offense at the accusations.
	- Price-Hill steps in and defends team based on the good they have done.

**Next Steps**
- Be present at Exhibition Gala at the natural history museum. Attempt to capture / kill thing inside Dr. Meridith.
- Others can be trained in the Thoughtform Attack skill that everyone in the team got from the rainbow bridge puzzle. We should share with RHC. Maybe beyond.
- Detect planar energy spell can be transcribed and shared. Kain suggests that the spellcasters share at the next downtime. This may allow us some flexibility in delegating some of the search tasks.

**Speculation**
- Finona mentioned that any gold can hold back the planar creatures. I believe that Rackus stated that recovered gold knives or daggers from the High Bayou ziggurat. The Voice of Rot told us we could appease it by "cutting" the outsider that escaped. (What happens after was unimportant to the titan.) Let's hedge our bets by trying to cut the thing with one of the gold daggers that Rackus has.

**Inter-session**
- Information back from irregulars (Sorghum and Starter)
	- > There are no obvious rumors of recovered magical items from a dig in Bole on the black market.  Kaja Stewart had a few items she was selling, but she's gone dark and Travis and Ford don't believe anyone has picked up her fencing gig with the Duke.  There was a decent sized gap since the last person was murdered / found brainless, but there were mutterings that it started up again (the morning you guys returned from Ber).  There was one oddity... that's being strangely covered up.  There are mutterings that someone broke into Saxby's Manor that night as well, there have been guards posted there since.  They're guessing nothing was stolen because nothings really been said about it.
- Find the rat who killed James Chadwell (person Kain is accused of killing) and make him wish for death.
